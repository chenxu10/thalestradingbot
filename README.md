### 1. Install uv
```bash
# On macOS and Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Or via pip
pip install uv
```

### 2. Set up the project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd thalestradingbot

# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
uv sync

# Activate the environment (optional, uv run handles this automatically)
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 3. Run the application
```bash
# Run with uv (recommended)
uv run python -m fentu.explatoryservices.volcalculator

# Or after activating the environment
python -m fentu.explatoryservices.volcalculator
```

## Main Functionality

This application is designed to analyze financial market data and identify historical worst-case scenarios. The core functionality includes:

### üìä Multi-Timeframe Return Analysis
- **Daily Returns**: Analyze day-to-day price movements
- **Weekly Returns**: Examine weekly performance patterns  
- **Monthly Returns**: Track monthly performance trends
- **Yearly Returns**: Assess annual performance metrics

### üîç Historical Crisis Detection
The application identifies and analyzes historical worst-case market events:
- **Worst-K Analysis**: Find the K worst performing periods (e.g., worst 5 days, worst 3 weeks)
- **Threshold Analysis**: Identify periods below specific return thresholds (e.g., all weeks with returns < -10%)
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Predict potential extreme events using statistical modeling
- **Left Tail Analysis**: Focus on the worst-case scenarios in return distributions

### üìà Visualization & Insights
- Interactive plots of return distributions for all timeframes
- Q-Q plots for distribution analysis
- Historical vs. expected worst-case comparisons
- Volatility surface visualization

### üéØ Usage Example
```python
from fentu.explatoryservices.volcalculator import VolatilityFacade

# Analyze a ticker (e.g., TQQQ, SPY, QQQ)
ticker = "TQQQ"
volatility = VolatilityFacade(ticker)

# Visualize returns
volatility.visualize_daily_percentage_change()
volatility.visualize_weekly_percentage_change()
volatility.visualize_monthly_percentage_change()

# Find worst-case scenarios
worst_days = volatility.find_worst_k_days(k=5)      # 5 worst days
worst_weeks = volatility.find_worst_k_weeks(k=3)    # 3 worst weeks
worst_months = volatility.find_worst_k_months(k=3)  # 3 worst months

# Crisis threshold analysis
crisis_weeks = volatility.find_worst_weeks(threshold=-0.1)  # Weeks with -10%+ losses
```

This tool is particularly valuable for risk management, helping traders and investors understand historical crisis patterns and prepare for potential future extreme market events.
