"""High/low levels over decision windows — where the stop clusters sit.

Paul Tudor Jones on moving volume (Market Wizards interview,
teams/paultudorjones.pdf, verbatim):

    "Tullis taught me about moving volume. When you are trading size, you
    have to get out when the market lets you out, not when you want to get
    out. He taught me that if you want to move a large position, you don't
    wait until the market is in new high or low ground because very little
    volume may trade there if it is a turning point."

    "One thing I learned as a floor trader was that if, for example, the old
    high was at 56.80, there are probably going to be a lot of buy stops at
    56.85. ... I will always liquidate half my position below new highs or
    lows and the remaining half beyond that point."

    "By watching Eli, I learned that even though markets look their very best
    when they are setting new highs, that is often the best time to sell."

Built for USO (oil, the war instrument), but `instrument` is any yfinance
ticker — the same levels logic applies to BNO, CL=F, GLD, SPY, ... USO reports
the trailing 2mo plus the regime since the 2026-02-28 US-Iran war start; every
other ticker reports the trailing 2mo and 6mo windows instead.

* ``uv run python -m fentu.explatoryservices.high_low_levels [TICKER]`` — print the
  two-window high/low levels report (default USO), or ``<TICKER> unavailable``
  on a network hiccup.
* ``uv run python -m fentu.explatoryservices.high_low_levels [TICKER] --plot`` — also
  chart the regime: close since war start, the old high/low signal lines with
  their print dates (one line per DISTINCT level — windows printing the same
  level merge, e.g. "2mo+6mo high"), and the shaded stop-cluster zones just
  beyond them (buy stops above old highs, sell stops below old lows — the
  56.80 -> 56.85 mechanism). One fetch feeds both the report and the chart.
