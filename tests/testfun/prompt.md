Want to write a unit test the big background is focusing on build a backtest portfolio. 
For now focus on plot out a performance of a index let's say qqq(for ndx100). 
Use TDD. 
- Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers") 
- Make test failures clear and informativ Here are in the half code - Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g., "shouldSumTwoPositiveNumbers") 
- Make test failures clear and informative. 
- Write just enough code to make the test pass 
- The code should follow F.I.R.S.T principles
